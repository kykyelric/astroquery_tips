# astroquery_tips

I'm not a professional astronomer, nor a professional programmer. I am, however, fairly decent at both, and I like to combine both skills to do some astrophysics research. 
Databases like VizieR are incredible resources. Python allows you to work with them in ways physical impossible. It's just learning how to get Python to do what you want that is the hard part. 
As I work with Python and its tools for astronomy, I will put the code for any particularly notable accomplishments here. 
I like to think that I put in the time to go through and try and try again so that you do not have to.
